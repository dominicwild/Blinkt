# Blinkt
A simple simon says game developed in Python. Made for a competition.

blinkt.py is a substitute for the real blinkt.py library that would accompany this. This python file would manipulate the real LED's. This was a unique challenge to separate the hardware dependencies during development. The library simulates what the real library would do and return in a very basic way. Which allows it to additionally be played from the commandline.

This made for more rapid development without needing to physically use a blinkt to see if it all worked correctly.

A UI is also featured using pygame.
